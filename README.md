# data-structures
I will use this repo to host abstract data types I have created for accessibility. These are for Python, but the structures themselves are universal.

I have plans of adding more data structures in the future, including but not limited to the deque, linked list, tree, 
binary tree, collections, and any other cool data structures I find out about that seem like they might be useful.

Ps, I'm sure all of these are already available online. All I would need to do is a simple google search.
However I am actually writing these out by hand, with references of course, but ultimately this is just for my own use to pull
any data structures I might want in the future.
